### 👋🏽  I'm Chris Lopez (He/Him/Él)

🔭 Building on my React skills for my next two projects: my portfolio site (looking to deploy through Github Pages) and a family cookbook recipe full stach web app (MERN).

🌱 I've just finished a software engineer cerrtification program at the [The Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/online-coding-bootcamp-part-time). I focused on learning full-stack webdevelopment with Python and MERN. Also wrapped up last updates I wanted to make for my Python/Flask fullstack application, [Super Social Reader](https://github.com/Lopez-CL/super_social_reader).

🫱🏽‍🫲🏿 🤗 I have a background in the Religious Studies and Library & Information Science. So, I'm down to collab on any open-source digital humanities project or Ed-Tech focused. I'm also passionate about technology & ethics, so I'm interested in anything focused on bettering living conditions, increasing connectivity, and championing social justice. *Currently doing a deep dive in artifical intelligence and building responsible AI. On the technical side of this interest, I'm currently Codeacademy's NLP/Datas Science course.*

⚡️  Fun fact: I used to be a pop culutre journalist, so if a lot of the projects I work on center sci-fi and comics, you know why 😅
