### 👋🏽  I'm Chris Lopez (He/Him/Él)

🔭 Honing my MERN skills with a [recipe sharing web application](https://github.com/Lopez-CL/sobreMesa).

🌱 Finished with my first draft of my [React Portfolio Site](lopez-cl.github.io/my-portfolios/) - highlights my multi-disciplinary background in religious studies, library & information science, and coding.


🫱🏽‍🫲🏿 🤗 I have a background in the Religious Studies and Library & Information Science. I'm down to collab on any open-source digital humanities project or Ed-Tech focused. I'm also passionate about technology & ethics, so I'm interested in anything focused on bettering living conditions, cultivating curiosity, increasing connectivity, and championing social justice. *Currently doing a deep dive in artifical intelligence and building responsible AI. On the technical side of this interest, I'm currently Codeacademy's NLP/Datas Science course.

⚡️  Fun fact: I used to be a pop culutre journalist, so if a lot of the projects I work on center sci-fi and comics, you know why 😅
